# IoT-Based School Attendance System Using RFID

## üí° Project Overview

This project automates the attendance process in educational institutions by utilizing RFID technology. Each student carries an RFID tag with a unique ID. When scanned, the student's attendance is marked automatically. 

Instead of deploying a cloud backend for prototyping, the system uses a **local Flask server** to manage attendance data, making it easier to demonstrate and test the system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Flask)
- **HTML/CSS** (Web interface)
- **MFRC522 RFID module**
- **Raspberry Pi 4**
